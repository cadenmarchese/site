<h2>cuckoo - big</h2>
<p>This is three of my friends' culmination of years of house shows and changing formats.<br>
They came to record in the bedroom live with some 4 track fun and recording improv as well<br>
as last minute lyrics and bass features. Vocals were done after the fact, in the middle of<br>
the room. I think there were also some fireplace overdubs we slipped in too. Favorite track<br>
is Scabs.</p>

<h2>don strasburg - don strasburg</h2>
<p>The sound of a rebellious band about to<br>
be over with itself, recorded in the record shop (thank you Doug) with what was.<br>
ultimately not enough microphones, but in the end even with all of the rough<br>
edges and tape distortion it remains something we are proud of. I believe<br>
there was only one more show after this one, and then we all quit.</p>

<h2>american grandma - superdog</h2>
<p>Bass amp in the kitchen, guitar amps in the spare room, drums in the<br>
bedroom, tuned slightly differently each day depending on temperature as<br>
recordings were spread out over several weeks, and we used our regular stuff<br>
amped up through tubes and mixed it in Cubase. Vocals were done quickly<br>
as we were up against Jensen's changing voice.</p>

<h2>terremoto - fun at parties</h2>
<p>I used to have a Pearl Export 6 piece drum kit. Now picture me, the kit,<br>
four other dudes, all of my material posessions including my bed all in a single<br>
15x15' room in a forest of microphone stands. You can hear us in the quiet<br>
moments of the album and in the buzz of the snare. At one point, my phone went off<br>
but they were cool with keeping it.</p>

<h2>xenon superstar - dreams are for babies</h2>
<p>This was my first time helping someone else record,<br>
and remains one of my favorite attempts. The band had drums without<br>
cymbals and just a few guitars, so we were able to have fun with microphone placement.<br>
We set two rode condensers at waist length on oppposite sides of the room, mic'd amps<br>
at the cone, and vocals were recorded inside of the closet between coats for dampening.<br>
I also attempted some tape saturation in post, but it spoke for itself without it.</p>

<h2>american grandma - sensation / forever</h2>
<p>Before there were American Grandma shows with the two of us, there were Logic Pro X files traded<br>
over Google Drive. This album is the result of a virtual band that didn't comunicate in the<br>
same room with the same ideas yet, and everything was recorded separately. Drums out in the living room,<br>
vocals wherever we could set up mics, and an overall confessional style.</p>

<h2>friends with benefits</h2>
<p>This was a group effort, but I had the privilege of lending lots of gear and mixing to<br>
several of the artists on this tape. Favorite tracks are All Bells and Willem Defoe.</p>
