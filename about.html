<p id="about">I'm a bass player and electronic musician
who has performed and recorded with American Grandma, Midwife, and Tenants,
and released music under the names Pill Super and Red Stitches. I've also been fortunate enough to have
collaborated as audio engineer or drummer on a handful of external projects, most of which are
listed on the site. I live in Queens NY, work in systems and software engineering,
and hold a BA in English from the University of Colorado Boulder, where I helped
to found and run the now-defunct record label First Base Tapes.
